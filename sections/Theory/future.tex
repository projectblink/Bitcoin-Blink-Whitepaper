\section{Future}

The future of the Bitcoin network includes building finance-specific L1 applications such as exchanges, bridges, lending \& borrowing, insurance, and mirrored wallets with current banking. Since these applications are developed inside an unlocking script, it requires preimage construction off-chain and settles onchain - inheriting the security of Bitcoin that centralized applications don't offer. Privacy can be improved by obscuring amounts similar to Monero with tax validation assisting regulators and masking financial information of a specific country. Emphasis on Zk delivery and validation of snips can reduce influence attacks in the future. 

Since Layer 1 is dynamically scalable, the need for an offline digital cash-payment system will be developed with suitable hardware wallets. To provide a decentralized programmable environment, a State Machine \cite{wood2014ethereum} featured with multiple high-level languages using LLVM \cite{llvm} IR code will be deployed as a layer that can update its global \& contract state by providing a gas limit through a receipt-proof paid in Bitcoin Network. The smart-contracts will not contain balances and EOAs, rather purely executed for business-logic to build DApps without a financial scope. Moreover, research will be conducted to merge various Bitcoin and altcoin chains for a clean experience on the whole of finance and computing.\\
