\subsection{Staking}
The chain native token - bitcoin can be staked for node's public keys with specified token IDs, where the collateral can be used only once for a block. This results in a stake per token per block bringing the throughput (tps), per token basis. The proofs are based on Zk-Snark based Semaphore protocol \cite{semaphore} which will allow users to prove their membership in a group and send signals without revealing the original identity. Each token per block's collateral requirement is given in market price by taking the mean volume of previous blocks. Staked bitcoins can be withdrawn at any time, with no vesting period, except when the block is being created. This brings in a retail and non-custodial solution as opposed to security deposit-type PoS chains. Delegators won't lose their stakes as slashing is done directly on the fees during forks. For specific nodes, bitcoins can be staked to collateralize or lock in its allocated block. Clients can provide their general users with a savings wallet in which they can benefit from an annual percentage yield by providing liquidity for staking. In this way, for a specific token's transaction to be included in a block, the first transaction should prove the collateral.
