\subsection{Regulation}
Regulation via centralized exchanges \& custodians risks funds and doesn't encourage a self-custodial ecosystem. A regulator must have the authority to sign or approve transactions. Whitelisting specific hashed public addresses belonging to specific countries, verified and signed by government-assigned client wallets or regulators, by either doing full KYC or something minimal such as mobile number-based OTP verification, could work with maximum privacy.

UTXOs are stamped with region proof on their unlocking script based on specific spending conditions that will only allow a transaction on-chain if taxes are deducted properly. Bitcoin scripts can work efficiently and securely, as opposed to turing-complete smart contracts in this case. Tax models such as capital gains slabs can be issued by governments trustlessly and are validated during the user's script execution. External taxes such as TDS and sales tax can be imposed off-chain with maximum flexibility. These three types of taxes provide almost all the tax models that a regulator can siphon into a centralized payment infrastructure.
