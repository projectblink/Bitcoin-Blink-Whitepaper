\subsection{Treasury}
For the active development and sustainability of the project, a DAO Treasury is set up to fund developers and the community. A minimal commission is imposed on producer fees and deposited to a treasury script. Memberships are non-fungible and non-transferable 1. Temporary (Core-Developers), 2.Permanent (Investors, Community), 3. Contracts (Employees, Operations) given in $x$ amount per $y$ term for $z$ period. Except Permanent members, votes are taken to decide membership and treasury decisions. Temporary members can be kicked for failure in active contribution whereas Permanent members cannot be kicked out due to their external contribution (funds) towards building the project. Permanent and Temporary members cannot be added after the first mainnet, but can appoint heirs to their registered membership. Contracts are paid out initially and the rest is provided to other memberships as dividends according to their weight. Participants are only rewarded for their active contribution, not indefinitely like holding a fungible token or speculative participation. A decentralized open-sourced organization structure is maintained with decisions involving votes brings forth a sustainable growth for the future of project blink.
