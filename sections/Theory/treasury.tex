\section{Treasury}
For the active development and sustainability of the project, a DAO Treasury is set up to fund developers and the community. A minimal commission is imposed on producer fees and deposited to a treasury script. Memberships are non-fungible and non-transferable 1. Temporary (Core-Developers), 2.Permanent (Investors, Community), 3. Contracts (Employees, Operations).

Votes can decide to add or remove contracts stating $x$ amount per $y$ term for $z$ period withdrawn during payouts. Votes can also decide to kick a temporary member due to any circumstantial issues or failure in active contribution. Permanent members cannot be kicked out due to their external contribution towards building the project. Permanent and Temporary members cannot be added after the base script deployment, but can appoint heirs to their membership. Contracts are paid out initially and the rest is provided to other memberships as dividends according to their weight. Core-Developers are only rewarded for their active contribution, not indefinitely like holding a fungible token or speculative participation. A decentralized open-sourced organization structure is maintained with decisions involving votes bringing forth sustainable growth for the future of project blink.
