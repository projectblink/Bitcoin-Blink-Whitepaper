\subsection{Bandwidth \& Weights}

Bandwidth proof here


Weights shall increment or decrement the posted bandwidth costing capital to nodes due to dishonest, lower performance or bandwidth.

\begin{align*}
\text{Null Block} = -0.015 \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\text{Time-outs} = -0.01 \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\text{Forks} = -0.01 \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\text{Fork Proof} = +0.01 \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\text{Age} = +0.05 \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\text{Extras} = +x \cdot (\widetilde{x}|\mathbb{R}|)\\
\end{align*}
Null Block weight is added if a producer fails to add any snip. Time-outs refers to intra-block forked block with no fees or rewards collected. Futher forks refer to the fork created by the other ring validators. Fork proofs can be provided by any ring validator before the fork to get incentivized, whereas the nodes in the path shall be equally punished. Age is a positive weight provided to producers with full block production without forks for the epoch. Extras is given for further native protocols such as oracles, etc.
