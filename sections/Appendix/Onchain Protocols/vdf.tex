\subsection{VDF \& Forks }

\begin{comment}
VDF how it works - continuous hash in a single thread, with concated snips data, each snip is bunch of transactions in linear.

Snip = pre-image + snip(transactions++)

all should attach preimage

When validating hash continuous with pre-image, if not empty snip, hash continuous - Find sum of hashes

Block time $\tau$ in given in number of hashes in global

local/global = intermediate

For each pubkey different intermediate hash

If sum of all snips <= intermediate hash - finish block

Each producer will have different snip data with merkle chain

To resolve, previous block with merkle chain root concated with next block.

All producers upgrade it, fork resolved
