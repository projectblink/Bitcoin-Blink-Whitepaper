\subsection{Ring Size}
The ring size is variable and it changes accordingly if a block is being subjected to intra block fork
- If fork ring size --, no tail
- If not fork ring size ++, 2 tails added

\subsection{Fork Proof}

Each Snip that is to be included with its VDF Proofs will have a node which will reject further snips. The origin of the fork can be taken by the previous node by providing the VDF Proof of unknown which can be validated. This can impose negative weights on the producers
