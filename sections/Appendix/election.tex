\subsection{Election}

Tail election is conducted for every block to assign nodes to mint blocks.

- Tails will be assigned from available nodes bandwidth proofs
- Weights are ordered in heavy
- From the current ring validators the mean value is taken
- The mean value is the joining requirement
- From the confirmed block, the block's merkle chain root and VDF proof is concated and produce a MD160hash
- The Nodes with weights more than the mean value is taken
- The node's pubkey which is lesser than the hash is assigned as node
- If there are no lesser value, then the nearby greater pubkeys are taken.
- If there are no pubkeys greater than the mean value, then the heaviest weight shall be taken, ignoring the hash
- All validators can verify the assigned node, as weights are available in the ledger and when the intra-block fork is resolved each validator will have the produced hash MD160 and it verifies
- If the assigned node is some other, the ring validators will not accept the block from it and it is treated as a null block.
